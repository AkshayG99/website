              <button class="btn btn-color-2 project-btn-learn" data-expand-text="I created a TicTacToe game using Python and PyGame. Leveraging PyGame's capabilities for game development, I designed an engaging and interactive version of this classic game. This project allowed me to enhance my programming skills in Python and gain experience in using PyGame for game mechanics and user interface design. By combining Python's versatility with PyGame's functionality, I developed a fun and accessible game experience.">
